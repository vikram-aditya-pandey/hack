# 📄 PDF Heading Extractor

Extracts structured multi-level headings (like H1 to H6) and document title from scanned or digital PDFs using font size, layout position, and heuristics.

This tool helps convert PDF documents into structured outlines, useful for document summarization, search, or feeding into LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.2, GPT-4).
